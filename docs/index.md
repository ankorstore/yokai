=== ":material-robot-happy: &nbsp;Simple"

	Yokai is a Go framework for `backend` applications that is `easy` to `use`, `configure` and `test`.

	Its automatic `dependecy injection` system enables you to focus on creating `clean` code.

=== ":material-view-module: &nbsp;Modular"

    Yokai comes with a `modules plugin system`.

	You can `extend` your application with the available `Yokai modules`, or create `your own`.
	

=== ":material-binoculars: &nbsp;Observable"

    Yokai has a strong focus on `observability`.

	It has built-in `logging`, `tracing` and `metrics` instrumentations, to build `predictable` applications.
