	With its automatic `dependecy injection system`, you can focus on creating `clean` code.

=== ":fontawesome-solid-cubes: &nbsp;Modular"

    Yokai comes with a `modules plugin system`.

	You can enrich your application with the `available modules`, or create `your owns`.
	

=== ":fontawesome-solid-binoculars: &nbsp;Observable"

    Yokai is focused on `observability`.

	It has built-in `logging`, `tracing` and `metrics`, based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) standards.
