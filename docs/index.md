	Yokai is a Go framework for `backend` applications that is `easy to use`, `configure` and `test`.

	With its automatic `dependecy injection system`, you can focus on creating `clean` code.

=== ":fontawesome-solid-cubes: &nbsp;Modular"

    Yokai comes with a `modules plugin system`.

	You can enrich your application with the available `Yokai modules`, or create `your owns`.

    Yokai has a strong focus on `observability`.

	It has built-in `logging`, `tracing` and `metrics` to build `predictable` applications.
